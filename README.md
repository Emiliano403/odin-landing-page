# odin-landing-page
Project for the foundations part of the odin project.

Notes:
Sketching the outline of the flexbox makes the work easier.
Flex containers can not have the flex growth/shrink characteristics.
Flex items can have text align.
Think of every item as a box.
Do not confuse margin and padding.
